    # Step-by-step workflow:
    # range(12) creates an iterator that produces 12 numbers: 0, 1, 2, ..., 11.
    
    # The loop variable is _ — a common convention meaning "I don’t care about this variable’s value."
    
    # For each iteration (12 times), it evaluates random.choice(characters):
    
    # random.choice(seq) picks one random element from the sequence seq.
    
    # Here, seq = characters — a string containing letters, digits, punctuation.
    
    # So on each iteration, it picks a random character from characters.
    
    # The generator yields 12 random characters, one at a time.
    
    # When you do ''.join(...) around this, it concatenates all 12 characters into a single string (no separator, empty string between them).


def generate_strong_password(length=16):
    """Generates a random, strong password."""
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for i in range(length))
